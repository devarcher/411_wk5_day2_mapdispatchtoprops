- You should see 4 (red) over 200 and 16 (orange) under 200. But wait.. since this data is connected to Redux it will change according to our actions. So go ahead and delete 3 users who's horsepower is under 200. Did you see the chart change? Again, since Dashboard, Chart and Total are all referencing the same data... they will always be in sync. The addition of the Pie Chart will always equal the total.

- One more thing, when you remove a user from the list you can also go to the homepage and notice that it's card has also been removed. Pretty cool, huh? It's all tied together.
